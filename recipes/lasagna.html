        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1.5 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>800g canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven to 160C</li>
        <li>For the bolognese, melt the butter and olive oil in a large flameproof casserole over medium heat. Add the chopped pancetta and cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes until it starts to crisp. Add the onion, celery, carrot and garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the beef and pork mince and cook for 8-10 minutes, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and nutmeg and simmer over medium heat for 4-5 minutes until the milk evaporates. Add the tomato paste and stir for 2-3 minutes until combined, then add the wine and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. Add canned tomatoes, stock and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, then cook in the oven for 2 hours or until thickened and reduced.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the bechamel, place milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat with onion, bay leaves, thyme and garlic, then bring to just below boiling point. Remove pan from heat, set aside for 30 minutes to infuse, then strain into a jug, discarding solids.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the cleaned pan over low heat. Add flour and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent browning. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming, then cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until mixture is thick and smooth. Add nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Cover surface closely with baking paper to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Grease a 5cm deep, 23 x 30cm ceramic or glass baking dish. Completely cover base with a layer of lasagne sheets - if needed, soak pasta in hot water for 5 minutes, then cut out pieces to fill any gaps. Spread with a third each of the bolognese and bechamel. Cover with half the mozzarella slices, then sprinkle with 4 tablespoons parmesan. Cover with more pasta and repeat each of these layers, then finish with the remaining pasta, bolognese and bechamel (reserve remaining parmesan).</li>
        <li>Cover dish with baking paper, then foil. Bake lasagne for 1 hour, then sprinkle top with the remaining parmesan. Bake, uncovered, for a further 20 minutes or until the top is bubbling and golden. Allow to rest for at least 20 minutes (this will ensure the lasagne holds together better), then slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
